# AERO Studio - 2023.1.44.0

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where vertical speed was not being properly calculated, resulting in incorrectly flagging a join event as too short
- Fixed issue where loading a new scene while having a spline selected would cause an invalid memory access operation
- Addressed regression where target splines were not being selected as expected
- Fixed issue where cached bug report files would cause subsequent bug reports to fail
- Fixed issue where any UI interaction would cause the hierarchy to jump to the top of the scroll view
